## Overview

`Layout` is a general-use layout component with a left and right side.
The left side is purely for the `NavBar` and is automatically added. Right side
is for content, and that is where children passed to `Layout` are rendered.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Layout} />

## Usage

Layout is not meant to be used outside of the `_app.tsx` file. This file is responsible
for setting up the root of the react tree. If rendered elsewhere, there may be
visible loading flashes between pages and/or duplicate NavBars shown.
