## Overview

`NavBar` is a web/mobile navigation bar component, which is automatically used
in the `Layout` component. It is route-aware and knows about the width of
the window it has been placed in.

On small devices, the `NavBar` will render as collapsed by default, taking up
less screen real-estate.

It collapses automatically when the window shrinks, but does not re-expand, when
the window grows again.

## Props

`NavBar` accepts no props. Is uses the router and `window` to do all the work
it needs to.

## Usage

Nav is not meant to be used outside of the `Layout` component. If rendered
elsewhere, there may be visible loading flashes between pages and/or duplicate
NavBars shown.
