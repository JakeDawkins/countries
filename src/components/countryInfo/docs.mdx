## Overview

The `CountryInfo` component is built to show a set of tiles with information
about a country. These tiles may include things like phone number prefix, or
currencies used.

<Story id="countryinfo--missing-pieces" />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={CountryInfo} />

The `CountryInfoFragment` is autogenerated from the GraphQL query made by the
parent component. Its generated type looks like this:

```ts
export type CountryInfoFragment = {
  __typename: 'Country';
  name: string;
  native: string;
  phone: string;
  capital?: string | null;
  emoji: string;
  currency?: string | null;
  continent: { __typename?: 'Continent'; name: string };
  languages: Array<{ __typename?: 'Language'; name?: string | null }>;
} & { ' $fragmentName'?: 'CountryInfoFragment' };
```

## Usage

Usage of this component should be fairly straightforward. If the parent component
requests the correct data from GraphQL, you should be able to pass a `Country`
directly to the component, like in the `pages/country/[code].page.tsx` file.

### Accessibility

This component includes tiles with two text elements that can be read by a screen
reader. The icon shown is not informative, so it's okay that it is left off from
the reading.
