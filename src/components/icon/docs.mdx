## Overview

The `Icon` component is a single component that allows rendering of any
available icons found under `components/icon/icons`. It is adjustable, and
prevents the need to use the individual icons in most cases.

<Story id="icon--playground" />

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Icon} />

## Usage

Icons must be given a `name` and a `size`, but otherwise, you don't _need_ to
pass anything else. If an icon needs to be aligned specially (like being given
margins), or given a background color, you can wrap the `Icon` in a `div` and
style the div appropriately.

### Accessibility

`Icon` has an `accessibilityLabel` prop which maps to the `aria-label` prop in
the dom. If the icon is meant to represent data and is _not purely decoration_,
then the `accessibilityLabel` prop should be used.

## Gallery

<Story id="icon--gallery" />
